## Documentation

TypingSpeed uses [api.quotable.io](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to generate random quotes from 900 different authors.

```javascript
fetch('https://api.quotable.io/random')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => data.content)
```

The Gross WPM is the typing speed without error penalties. To mathematically calculate the Gross WPM, the number of typed entries (key depressions) is divided by 5 (a word has a length of 5 characters), then divided by the elapsed time (min).

The accuracy is defined by the percentage of correct entries out of the total typed entries.
